            Today, the publication of research data plays an important role in astronomy 
            and astrophysics. On the one hand, dedicated programs, such as surveys like 
            <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">SDSS</a> and 
            <a href="http://www.rave-survey.aip.de/rave/">RAVE</a>, 
            data intensive instruments like <a href="http://www.lofar.org/">LOFAR</a>, 
            or massive simulations 
            like <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/millennium/">Millennium</a> and 
            <a href="http://cas.sdss-mirror.de/dr7/en/">MultiDark</a> 
            are initially planned to release their data 
            for the community. On the other hand, for more traditionally oriented research 
            projects data publication becomes a key requirement demanded by the funding 
            agencies.

        <p>
            The common approach is to publish this data via dedicated web sites. This 
            includes rather simple HTML forms as well as complex query systems such as 
            <a href="http://casjobs.sdss.org/CasJobs/">SDSS-CAS</a> or the 
            <a href="http://www.rave-survey.aip.de/rave/pages/database/">RAVE database query interface</a>. 
            Most of these web sites are 
            tailor made for the particular case and are therefore not easily transferrable 
            to future projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At AIP, we gained experience with both the maintenance and the 
            development of such applications. The 
            <a href="http://www.rave-survey.aip.de/rave/pages/database/">RAVE</a> 
            and <a href="http://www.multidark.org/MultiDark/">MultiDark</a>
            databases, the <a href="http://cas.sdss-mirror.de/dr7/en/">German SDSS mirror</a>, 
            and several smaller web sites are written or at least maintained by us. It became, however, 
            apparent that already the current plethora of applications constitutes a major challenge 
            for maintenance expenses and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to address these issues, we are developing a new web framework, which 
            is particularly designed to allow for different highly customizable web applications 
            based on a common easily maintainable code base. It is called <b>Daiquiri</b>. As a service
            to the community the software is open source. Download <a href="https://github.com/jochenklar/daiquiri">
            Daiquiri</a> and this <a href="https://github.com/jochenklar/daiquiri-app">Daiquiri application</a>
            as a template / starting point.

            This page itself is already made using Daiquiri. You can explore the different features
            and perform queries on a simple dataset. In addition you find all the information 
            needed to host your own Daiquiri application for <i>your</i> data.
